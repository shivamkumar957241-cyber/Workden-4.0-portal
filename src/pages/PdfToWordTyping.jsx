A stratified random sample of 450 students from five universities was surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS software with correlation and regression analysis techniques.\n\nKey Findings:\nResults indicate a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.48, p < 0.01) between excessive social media usage (more than 4 hours per day) and academic performance as measured by CGPA. Students who used social media primarily for academic purposes showed no significant impact on performance. The study also found that 72% of respondents accessed social media during study hours at least once daily.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study recommends digital literacy programs, parental monitoring, and institutional guidelines to promote balanced social media usage among students.\n\nKeywords: Social Media, Academic Performance, Undergraduate Students, Digital Literacy, Maharashtra` },

Payments emerged as the most funded segment with $1.8 billion in investments, reflecting the rapid expansion of UPI-based businesses and cross-border payment solutions.\n\nNotable deals of the year included a $200 million Series D round by fintech startup CreditPulse and a $150 million investment in digital insurance platform PolicyBridge, both of which are backed by leading global venture capital firms.\n\n"India's fintech ecosystem continues to mature rapidly," said Dr. Nikhil Rao, Chief Economist at the National Payments Corporation of India. "The combination of a large unbanked population, growing smartphone penetration, and supportive regulatory environment makes India one of the most attractive fintech markets globally."\n\nSmall business lending and rural financial inclusion emerged as the fastest-growing sub-segments, with 34 new startups launching products specifically targeting tier-2 and tier-3 city customers.\n\nIndustry observers expect continued growth in 2025, driven by the Government's Digital India mission and the Reserve Bank of India's progressive regulatory framework for new-age financial products.` },
